# Overview

> *The scientific culture in the country is underdeveloped, with minimal publications attributed to Malian authors and researchers. We would like to use this forum to bring together and encourage aspiring researchers and researchers from diverse fields to investigate various subjects related to machine learning or work on projects for local downstream applications. This call is not limited to academic research, industry solutions worthy of highlights should submit as well. Although we are not a big research venue, we encourage both Malians abroad and local researchers to submit work, to be presented and showcased. Candidates have the possibility to submit a full research paper (completed or preliminary manuscripts), or position paper responding to one or more of the underlying themes of the workshop.*

> * ***`How to make ML research be cheaper for communities with limited resources?`***
> * ***`What are strategies and techniques to overcome the limitation in resources?`***
> * ***`Edge AI / ML for the under-served communities`***
> * ***`Collaborative ML  and Shared resources`***
> * ***`Low-cost efficient Machine Learning Algorithms`***
> * ***`Embedded Machine Learning`***

> *For the position papers you are not limited to the points highlighted you can also respond your own questions. You can also join our weekly office hours [slot] if you need to learn more about the call.*
