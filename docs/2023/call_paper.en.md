# Call for papers

> *The scientific community in Mali is currently limited, with few publications from Malian authors and researchers. To address this gap, we are hosting a forum to encourage and bring together aspiring and established researchers from diverse fields to explore various subjects related to machine learning and work on projects with local applications. We welcome submissions from both academic researchers and industry professionals, and we aim to showcase a range of innovative solutions.*

> *While we may not be a large research venue, we invite both Malians abroad and local researchers to submit their work for presentation and discussion. We welcome full research papers, as well as preliminary manuscripts and position papers, that respond to one or more of the underlying themes of the workshop. We hope that this initiative will contribute to the growth of the scientific community in Mali and inspire more research in this field. Potential questions that can be considered are: *

> * ***`How to make ML research be cheaper for communities with limited resources?`***
> * ***`What are strategies and techniques to overcome the limitation in resources?`***
> * ***`Edge AI / ML for the under-served communities`***
> * ***`Collaborative ML  and Shared resources`***
> * ***`Low-cost efficient Machine Learning Algorithms`***
> * ***`Embedded Machine Learning`***

> *In addition to addressing the themes highlighted in the call, we welcome position papers that explore other relevant questions or perspectives. If you have any questions about the call or would like to learn more about the submission process, we encourage you to join our weekly office hours on [day and time slot]. Our team will be available to provide guidance and answer any questions you may have.*
