**`Challenge`**

> *For this competition, you are tasked to solve a real problem faced by the country using ML. Challengers are encouraged to work on any problem domain that they deem critical for the development of the country/region.*
>
> *Solutions can look at algorithmic efficiency and optimization using a theoretical approach, or can work on actual products for marketability. Listed below are some example projects and domains for inspiration:*
>
> * **`Autonomous Systems, Robotics, and Manufacturing, Logistics`**
> * **`Efficient Energy Distribution to minimize ‘Blackouts’`**
> * **`Healthcare and Intelligent trial drugs synthesizers i.e for Malaria`**
> * **`Predicting Migratory Patterns for the Armed Terrorist Groups in the Sahel`**
> * **`Sustainable Communities and Infrastructures`**
> * **`Retail Management`**
> * **`Automatic speech translator for local languages`**
> * **`Smart & Intelligent Agriculture`**
>
> *For your solution, you should take the 'low-cost' aspect as an integral idea of the solution. Your solution should focus on Compression and Quantization, and considerably take them into account in your design. You will be judged by the efficiency of the solution in the most extreme use cases. Challengers are encouraged to look for alternative approaches to reduce the cost of traditional Machine Learning approaches in terms of complexity and the computational resources required to train and run inference on proposed systems.*

> **`Note that you do not need a complete solution. Prototypes are accepted.`**

**`Criteria`**

> *Due to the fact that we have a number of limited seats at the workshop, we will have a selection phase where 10 teams will be selected to compete. The participation criteria for the competition are the following:Solution is made in Mali or made for MaliTeams can have 2 to 5 members, and preferably at least one member of the team must be Malian.The solution must be ML / AI-centric, with accompanying benchmarks*
