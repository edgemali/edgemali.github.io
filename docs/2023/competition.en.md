**Challenge**

> Ready to make a difference? In this competition, you have the opportunity to tackle real-world problems faced by the country using ML. We encourage participants to choose any problem domain they deem critical for the development of the country or region.

> Your solution can focus on algorithmic efficiency and optimization using a theoretical approach, or you can work on actual products for marketability. Here are some example projects and domains for inspiration:

> - **Autonomous Systems, Robotics, and Manufacturing Logistics**
- **Efficient Energy Distribution to minimize blackouts**
- **Healthcare and Intelligent drug synthesizers for diseases like Malaria**
- **Predicting Migratory Patterns for Armed Terrorist Groups in the Sahel**
- **Sustainable Communities and Infrastructures**
- **Retail Management**
- **Automatic speech translator for local languages**
- **Smart & Intelligent Agriculture**

> When designing your solution, remember to prioritize low cost. Your solution should focus on Compression and Quantization, and consider them considerably in your design. Judges will evaluate the efficiency of your solution in the most extreme use cases, and we encourage you to look for alternative approaches to reduce the cost of traditional machine learning approaches in terms of complexity and computational resources.

Note that prototypes are accepted and you do not need to provide a complete solution.

**Criteria**

> As we have limited seats available, we will have a selection phase for the workshop. Less than 10 teams will be chosen to compete, so make sure you meet our participation criteria:

>Your solution must be made in Mali or made for Mali
Teams must consist of 2 to 5 members, with at least one member preferably being Malian. Your solution must be ML/AI-centric, with accompanying benchmarks. To learn more about the competition, join our weekly Office Hour at **Sundays 4pm UTC**. We look forward to hearing from you!
