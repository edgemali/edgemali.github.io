# ML at the Edge: Cheaper AI

## Announcements

## Overview

> Researchers in the Sahel region struggle to conduct effective research due primarily to the lack of necessary resources. Recent advancements in Machine Learning have opened up a number of research opportunities and intelligent solutions for the developing world. Limited resourcefulness by itself is a problem that needs to be resolved, making it an avenue for researchers in the region. The workshop will center around Edge AI as a case study and it aims to bring a sleigh of researchers, aspiring researchers, practitioners, and students together to explore machine learning research, low-resource innovation, as well as low-cost machine learning solutions. Additionally, we hope to pave the way for a culture of scientific research academically and industrially.
