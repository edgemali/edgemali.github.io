# ML at the Edge: Cheaper AI (Jul 7th - 8th)

## Announcements

## Abstract
> The inadequate availability of resources poses a significant challenge for researchers in the Sahel region to conduct effective research. However, recent advancements in Machine Learning present several opportunities for research and intelligent solutions in the developing world. Addressing the issue of limited resources itself is a promising area for researchers in the region. To that end, the workshop will focus on Edge AI as a case study and seek to bring together researchers, aspiring researchers, practitioners, and students to delve into machine learning research, low-resource innovation, and cost-effective machine learning solutions. The overarching goal of the workshop is to foster a culture of scientific research both academically and industrially.

## Workshop Objectives

> This workshop provides a platform for researchers, aspiring ML researchers, engineers, industry leaders, creatives, artists, students, makers, and practitioners from diverse backgrounds to come together and ponder on low-cost ML solutions for Mali and the Sahel region. We aim to have exchanges on techniques, problems, and strategies regarding low-resource situations, and applications of general ML and Edge AI in the country. We expect to address all the viewpoints surrounding the subject, and we do not intend to limit our discussion to Edge AI, an emphasis will be made on 'making cheaper AI solutions'. Accordingly, the objectives of the workshop are:

> - Determine the cost/benefits of limited resourcefulness in Mali.
- Identify Edge AI / ML opportunities and downstream applications for the country in Healthcare, Manufacturing, Agriculture, Mining, Security, the Arts and so on
- Identify new strategies and techniques for Applied-ML at the Edge that are unique to the region.
- Engage students, researchers, and industry leaders in applied low-resource Machine Learning solutions.
- Ethical / Responsible AI
- Build a community around minimizing the cost of ML solutions for Mali and the Sahel region.
