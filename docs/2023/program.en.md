## Pre-Workshop

* **Weekly Meeting**

> *We will hold weekly information and question-and-answer meetings online for the general public starting on 3/30th until [date] the last Sunday before the workshop. The objective of these meetings is to inform prospective participants to better understand the workshop and better prepare for it. We hope to address all issues and concerns attendees will have. We will have sessions on the application procedure and some complex topics such as Introduction to overleaf and LaTex, the templates, A primer on Edge AI, and Embedded Machine Learning.*

---

* **Website**

> *We will create a website to introduce the subject of the workshop, in addition, we will have all the necessary information about the application, the calendar, the competition, the call for papers/posters, and contact information posted on the website: [https://edgemali.github.io/2023](https://edgemali.github.io/2023). The website will update accordingly to inform the participants and prospective participants of the event. After the workshop, we will use the website to publish all of the papers and work showcased as well as all the solutions presented for the competition.*

---

* **Recruitment**

> *We aim to recruit Malian researchers, practitioners, decision-makers and aspiring researchers from diverse fields varying from machine learning to engineering to arts from abroad or locally with the goal of having the most diverse group of individuals at the workshop come and collectively think about Edge AI and Low-cost AI and their applications in Mali. We will recruit participants via a number of channels including but not limited to social media campaigns using Twitter, WhatsApp, and Facebook as well as mailing lists, word of mouth will be our primary channel locally, and posting fliers at major universities in the country. We will have three modes of participation, general application, competition, and the call for papers.*

---

* **Application**

> *We will have a public application form for participants to apply for attendance, for the Week of AI. The form will be open for a month, starting on April 1st and closing on April 24th. Attendance will be free for students and a $25 fee for professionals for badges and t-shirts. The number of attendees will be limited to 100 people, 75 students / 25 professionals.*

---

* **Workshop Mode**

> *The workshop will be an in-person event in Bambara-English-French trilingual activity based on the featured speakers, we will make sure to have synchronous online sessions available (with Zoom, Meet, or Teams) for those who are unable to attend the event physically. Based on registration, extra accommodation will be made available for non-able individuals.*

---

* **Venue / Facilities and Materials**

> *The exact venue is TBD at a later date. The venue must be able to have a large room (amphitheater) capable of holding 100+ attendees. A hall will be needed for the sponsor booths and project display. A refreshment room and/or cafeteria will be needed for coffee breaks and lunch. Several (at least 3) rooms will be needed to host practicals and tutorials. A/V capabilities and installations should be made available for all the rooms.*

## Workshop

> *The discussions and the materials used and presented at the workshop including the papers and projects will be hosted on the website. We will post the different hypotheses and potential research questions brought up on different platforms to encourage research and development. More importantly, we plan to create a community of participants to continue the work on cheaper AI solutions for the region. Selected papers will be proposed for Deep Learning Indaba[ref] research in Africa Day poster sessions.*
